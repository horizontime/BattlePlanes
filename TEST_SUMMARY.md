## Key Features Tested

### Skull Pickup Behavior ✅
- [x] **Holder Team ID Storage**: When a player picks up the skull, their team ID is stored in `holder_team_id`
- [x] **Team ID Synchronization**: Team ID is properly synchronized across all clients
- [x] **Cross-team Pickup**: Any player (including teammates) can pick up the skull when it's dropped

### Skull Drop Behavior ✅
- [x] **Team ID Reset**: When skull is dropped (death or manual), `holder_team_id` is reset to -1
- [x] **Normal Spawn**: Skull spawns normally after being dropped and can be picked up by anyone
- [x] **Client Synchronization**: Drop state is properly synchronized to all clients

### UI Display ✅
- [x] **Team Time Display**: Shows team skull time in the score UI for Team Oddball mode
- [x] **Skull Status**: Shows "Your team is holding the skull" for same-team players
- [x] **Enemy Status**: Shows "Team X is holding the skull" for enemy team players
- [x] **Free Status**: Shows "Skull is free" when no one is holding it

### Team Play Integration ✅
- [x] **Existing Team Oddball Logic**: Reuses existing Team Oddball scene and scoring system
- [x] **Player Team Assignment**: Uses existing player.team assignments
- [x] **Score Tracking**: Integrates with existing team_skull_time tracking in GameManager

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Skull Spawn
- ✅ Skull spawns at center of map
- ✅ `holder_team_id` starts as -1 (no team)
- ✅ UI shows "Skull is free"

### Scenario 2: Team A Player Picks Up Skull
- ✅ `holder_team_id` becomes 0 (Team A)
- ✅ Team A players see "Your team is holding the skull"
- ✅ Team B players see "Team A is holding the skull"
- ✅ Skull follows the holder

### Scenario 3: Holder Dies
- ✅ Skull drops at death location
- ✅ `holder_team_id` resets to -1
- ✅ UI shows "Skull is free"
- ✅ Any player (Team A or Team B) can pick it up

### Scenario 4: Teammate Picks Up Dropped Skull
- ✅ Teammate from same team can pick up the skull
- ✅ Teammate from enemy team can pick up the skull
- ✅ Team ID updates to new holder's team
- ✅ UI updates accordingly

### Scenario 5: Manual Drop
- ✅ If manually dropped, skull becomes available to all players
- ✅ `holder_team_id` resets to -1
- ✅ Normal pickup logic applies

## Code Quality Check ✅

### Syntax Validation
- [x] All GDScript syntax is correct
- [x] Variable declarations are properly typed
- [x] Function signatures match expected parameters
- [x] RPC decorators are properly formatted

### Integration Check
- [x] Changes integrate seamlessly with existing Team Oddball mode
- [x] No conflicts with existing GameManager logic
- [x] UI changes don't interfere with other game modes
- [x] Network synchronization maintains consistency

### Error Handling
- [x] Null checks for skull existence
- [x] Validation of team assignments
- [x] Safe access to UI elements
- [x] Proper cleanup when mode changes

## Conclusion

All requested features have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Reuse existing Oddball skull scene** - No changes needed to scene, only script modifications
2. ✅ **On skull pickup, store `holder_team_id`** - Implemented in `pickup_skull()` function
3. ✅ **On holder death or manual drop, skull spawns normally** - Implemented in `drop_skull()` function  
4. ✅ **Any player can pick it up (even teammates)** - No restrictions added, uses existing pickup logic
5. ✅ **UI shows "Your team is holding the skull"** - Implemented in `_update_skull_status()` function

The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing codebase while adding the requested team play functionality for the Oddball skull mechanics.
